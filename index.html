                        My objectives were to determine technical solutions and recommendations and to communicate them to the users, to analyze technical problems, to inform the users of the technical problems found and of the modifications and repairs to be made, to train users to a product or an equipment and to carry out the technical follow-up of the products and their evolution with the users.
